# DLS 
Key : Parametrize Higher LEvel deep Learning techniques and models, methods + Compose them, etc End to End -> Super Useful !
Where YOU FOCUS on the Parameters of SOTA, opti-personalisable Architectures. 
The Key will be the front-end and extensibility proposed

Ex : 
- Create Your base Model (selection phase + extension)
- Instances.
-> Made Very Simple with a few Lines of Code.
  (Follow FaceBook Large Concept Model pipeline, etc. + Ask for Clear loaders, online, etc. + toApp function to create Server, etc. + All is Optimized for the non-deep learning stuff using Scala! and also python)
Note : Parameters are were it matters!
-> And also : Regularly Implements SOTA methods from papers, etc + Active Research. AND ALLOW You to also run Algoruthms on Architecture itself, etc. 


DL as a science in istelf, the way machine will learn our axioms, etc in the Future -> This REPO will be super important -> Par sa Prise de Partie. 
Explique les choses qui sont importante pour comprendre le Deep Learning et pourquoi cela sera une Science Omniprésente dans les générations à venir aussi, etc. 
Backend : Python & Scala (maybe for Type Systems, modularity, protoBuf for distributed Stuff, etc for different things. FrontEnd: Python & Scala)
A Higher Level library than PyTorch or TensorFlow. A bit theoritical. With SOTA methods and programs, and their Applications, in Finance, etc. 


Deep Learning Science . Mainly in Pyhton, (and some theoritical implementations also in Scala, GANS, Transformers, etc. , with Lazyness, for-comp, ZIO, etc)
Allowing E2E projects (loaders, pre-processing with right Spark Wrappers, Graphs, Geometric Deep Learning, etc). 
Will Become the Main Library used at Blue Research for Deep Learning research. (and Online, Also RL, etc). 

For now : Deep Learning Science and in Pyhton (mostly). But also we have maybe scala files for spark stuff, sparkML, etc.

Will have a key bindings in scala, etc. 

A more Higher-level that PyTorch for Implemeting SOTA DL methods without having to re-code them ! + Allow modularity, etc !
