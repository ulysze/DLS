# DLS 
Deep Learning Science . Mainly in Pyhton, (and some theoritical implementations also in Scala, GANS, Transformers, etc. , with Lazyness, for-comp, ZIO, etc)
Allowing E2E projects (loaders, pre-processing with right Spark Wrappers, Graphs, Geometric Deep Learning, etc). 
Will Become the Main Library used at Blue Research for Deep Learning research. (and Online, Also RL, etc). 

For now : Deep Learning Science and in Pyhton (mostly). But also we have maybe scala files for spark stuff, sparkML, etc.

Will have a key bindings in scala, etc. 

A more Higher-level that PyTorch for Implemeting SOTA DL methods without having to re-code them ! + Allow modularity, etc !
